###A Spigot Plugin which enables fly for a player as long as he holds an item 

This plugin is tested on 1.8.X. It will enable fly for a player as long as he holds 
an specific item which is set in the config (Default: Netherstar)

If the Item ID is invalid the plugin uses 399 (NetherStar) instead without changing the config.
Also users with permission `lobbyfly.admin` and OPs get a notification that the ID is invalid
